# AndroidEnvironment
Emulator to help run 'NarratorAndroid' only in the JVM.

As I was testing 'NarratorAndroid' testing was really slow, because it was done by hand.  To speed up my time, and to keep testing in Eclipse, I wrote and environment to run the Android java files.  It gets updated as I write more and better tests for 'NarratorAndroidTester'.
